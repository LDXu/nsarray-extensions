This is small category that adds Ruby-style collection operations to NSArray.  These functions are intended for convenience and have not been optimized for operating on very large collections.

Also, note that because you cannot put primitive, non-NSObjects into an NSArray, you have to be cognizant of that when working with these collection functions on object properties that are not NSObjects.
